## Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of field agents at company X, who capture and collect information about farmers, ranging from KYC data to the polygon/outlines of a farmer's field. The aim is to design an effective incentive structure to motivate the field agents and improve their productivity by rewarding the agents based on their input.

## Problem Statement
As Company X tracks the number of tasks completed by each field agents daily over a 83-days period, it aims to design an incentive structure that motivates agents, particularly those close to the top perfomers who need to reach their full potential. The challlenge is to create a fair and effective incentive plan that motivates all the field agents while maintaining the average compensation per task at a minimum of Ksh 175 and a maximum of Ksh 300.

## Objectives
1. To analyze individual and overall agents performance by calculating mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum of the number of tasks completed.
2. To design an easy to understand and implement incentive structure by;
 a) Developing a per-task payment rate that meets the financial criteria.
 b) Proposing a weekly performance bonus to motivate the agents near the top performers.

3. To offer data-driven insights into agent performance and recommend ways to improve agent productivity and satisfaction.

## Tools
The following tools were used;

1. **Python**:
- **Pandas** - For data manipulation
- **Numpy** - For numerical operations and calculations
- **Matplotlib** - For data visualizations and plots
- **Seaborn** - For advanced data visualizations

2. **Excel** - For data storage and review
3. **Jupyter Notebook** - IDE for writing and running python codes, dispalying visuals and documenting the analysis report.
